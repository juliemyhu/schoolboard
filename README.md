### How to locally run SchoolBoard
Here is how to run the app locally on your machine.

1. Download this repository 
2. Obtain API keys. Make sure the repository has access to keys. (I put my API in a secrets.sh file and ran it in my virtual env) 
    - [College AI API](https://api-manager.collegeai.com/)
    - [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)
3. Add a virtual environment to the directory (optional)
    - download a virtual environment like [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)
    ```bash
    vagrant up #activate vagrant
    vagrant ssh #login to vagrant
    cd src/projects/school_board # go to directory where school_board is located 
    virtualenv env # set up directory to have virtual env 
    source env/bin/activate #activate virtual environment
    pip3 install -r requirements #download requirements into virtual environment
    python3 server.py # launch server
    ```
4. If not using a virtual environment, make sure you install requirements in local environment

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements # download requirements into local environment 
    python3 server.py # launch server
    ```
5. After running server.py go to localhost and start using SchoolBoards!
